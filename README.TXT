PROJECT TITLE: Mini Project - stock market investor simulation
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: OOPMP   
VERSION or DATE: 2019
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
AUTHORS: Sean Palmer
USER INSTRUCTIONS:

Please note that for the purpose of the project the protected attributes has been changed from an array to an arraylist to meet the requirements, the previous implementation for just an array has been left in so a comparision can be made.

Please also remeber that we cannot sell a protected stock - this is an emulator and protected stocks only get sold as and when the protected price is met on the stock market.

Please lastly remember that when we want to find the length of an array list we use the arraylistname.size(), similarly we can then use arraylistname.get(index), where index is an int we can then postfix this with attributes that may be associated with this type for instance arraylistname.get(index).name (this would be if the arraylist was of type <type> definded for instance to have a String name within the object
